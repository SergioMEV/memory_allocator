# C Memory Allocator
This is my implementation of `malloc`, C's memory allocation function. 
I created this for my operating systems class in order to get a better handle on memory and memory management in C.
Definitely a good project for anyone trying to get down to the nitty gritty memory stuff with C, a language notorious for its stinginess with memory.
